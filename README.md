## ðŸš€ About Me

I am currently retraining to become a front-end developer and am taking the Application Developer - JavaScript React course at OpenClassrooms.

The objective of this training is to acquire a specialization in front-end and to consolidate the knowledge that I obtained during my previous training in web development.

The ultimate goal is to find a first position as a junior web developer to perfect my skills and gain more experience.
